      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a platform for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. The standardized units called containers virtualize the operating system of a server. Software is packaged into containers that have everything it needs to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands users can use to build, start, or stop containers. Docker works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors. Users can develop on Windows, Linux, or macOS. With Docker, users get a single object that can reliably run anywhere.

      Containers comprises just the application and its dependencies. It runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with other containers. Thus, it enjoys the resource isolation and allocation benefits of virtual machines but requires far fewer resources and is much more portable and efficient. So using Docker lets users ship code faster, standardize application operations, seamlessly move code, and save money by improving resource utilization. \n
