      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a platform for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. The standardized units called containers virtualize the operating system of a server. Software is packaged into containers that have everything it needs to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands users can use to build, start, or stop containers. Docker works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors. Users can develop on Windows, Linux, or macOS. With Docker, users get a single object that can reliably run anywhere. Containers comprises just the application and its dependencies. It runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with other containers. Thus, it enjoys the resource isolation and allocation benefits of virtual machines but requires far fewer resources and is much more portable and efficient. So using Docker lets users ship code faster, standardize application operations, seamlessly move code, and save money by improving resource utilization. <br />

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and first publicly released in 2004. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, Nginx can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. Nginx follows event-based process; it does not create individual thread of request for each process like Apache does, but smartly follows events of a process. Nginx is Asynchronous; that means each request in Nginx can be executed concurrently without blocking each other like a water pipe. So this way Nginx enhances the virtually shared resources without being dedicated and blocked to one connection. So Nginx is able to do the same work with less amount of memory and utilizes that memory in an optimized way. Nginx accelerates content and application delivery, improves security, facilitates availability and scalability for the busiest websites on the Internet. <br />

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>In computing, a virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination. They run in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they were not originally intended for. <br />Sources used: <br />

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean, Inc. is an American cloud infrastructure provider that provisions virtual servers for software developers. The company is headquartered in New York City and possesses data centers worldwide. DigitalOcean provides cloud services that help developers deploy and scale applications that run on multiple computers simultaneously. With DigitalOcean, developers can launch their own private virtual machines called "droplets." Developers choose the droplet's size, which geographical region and data center it will run in, and which Linux operating system it will use: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS or FreeBSD. Secure Shell (SSH) is also supported for secure communication. <br />
